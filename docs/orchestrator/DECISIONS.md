# Decisions log

Each entry: what, why, and the job id where relevant. Assignment changes get a one-line
"assignment reasoning" as required by the run brief.

## D1 — Branch strategy (20:36 IST)
`main` is never committed to. All work lands on `integration/research`, then
`integration/prototype` (branched from research); agy job branches merge only into the
matching `integration/*` branch. Why: the run brief forbids merging into `main`, and a
linear topic branch lets a restarted session resume from a single HEAD.

## D2 — No package installs (20:36 IST)
Use the system Python 3.12 with the already-present `pytest` 7.4.4 and `cryptography`
41.0.7 (also `nacl`). No `.venv` needed and no network installs, which keeps the run
inside the "no packages/network" safety rule. `.venv/` stays git-ignored in case a
session later needs one.

## D3 — Frames are opaque bytes (20:36 IST)
Transports carry `bytes` frames rather than dicts, so the optional Fernet codec is a
pure wrap/unwrap and fakes stay trivial. The plaintext frame is canonical JSON from
`protocol.encode_frame`. Recorded in `docs/design/interfaces.md`.

## D4 — Echo prevention keyed on content hash of the last clipboard state (20:36 IST)
After applying a remote payload the engine sets `_last_local_hash`, so the next local
read cannot re-send it. Dedup also uses `msg_id` and per-origin `seq`. Why not a
time-window suppression set alone: it can drop a legitimate re-copy. Known limitation:
a backend that normalizes image bytes breaks hash equality; documented.

## D5 — Prototype stays phone-free and cloud-free (20:36 IST)
All tests use `FakeClipboard`, `InMemoryTransport`/`FileTransport` and fixed fixtures.
`WlClipboardBackend` is implemented against an injectable runner but never executed;
only its pure command-building/`choose_mime` helpers are tested. Why: the real
clipboard may hold passwords and the brief forbids touching it.

## D6 — Probe before committing research chunks to agy (20:36 IST)
Baseline `agy_usage`: weekly 24.4%, 5h 99.2% (floor 20%/15%). Job 1 is a cheap
read-only research probe so the quota cost per job and agy's research quality are
known before assigning more work. Assignment reasoning: agy is the default owner of
self-contained research; the probe is the cheapest way to price the rest.

## D7 — Research owner split (provisional, 20:36 IST)
R1 (Android restrictions) and R3 (options landscape) are drafted by agy because they
are source-heavy and self-contained; R2 (GNOME Wayland + MIME limits) and R4
(synthesis/recommendation) stay with me because they need judgement and must agree
with the prototype. Reasoning: agy never sees this conversation, so broad-but-
bounded web research is the best fit; synthesis is cross-cutting.
